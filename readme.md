# Keychron K7 (Optical)

![Keychron K7](https://github.com/chent7/keychron_k7_optical_ansi_qmk_via/blob/master/resources/keyboard.jpeg?raw=true)

Flash with [Sonix Flasher](https://github.com/SonixQMK/sonix-flasher) \
Source should be used with [SonixQMK](https://github.com/SonixQMK/qmk_firmware) and will be unmaintained from me \
There's no need for jumploader (You can't flash QMK without flashing over it)

My mod for K7 (Optical RGB)
* RGB Matrix effects included
* 1ms, eager debounce and 12 keys per scan for rhythm games
* VIA enabled
* Reduced USB detection problems (WIP)

Special Thanks:
